 Hello Coffee Meets Bagel iOS Developer,
 
 I wanted to write a file to answer some questions and clarify things I've done in the code for this submission.
 
 First off... Why the heck did I use SwiftyJSON for such a basic architected JSON file?
    I did this intentionally to show that I understood how to utilize Cocoapods, and work with a 3rd party framework. This is just 1 I've used before and it could be used appropriately in this project. However with a JSON file structure this simplistic, a few Guard statements and I would've been parsed out just fine and moving on but I wanted to show competency in 3rd party frameworks.
 
 2ndly... Why did you add to the JSON file?
    Well, it just seemed like a neat way to say hi to you in case I wasn't given an opportunity to after you see this code... SO... HELLO!
